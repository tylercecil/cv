Here is an unordered list of single 'bullet-points' that represent career
achievements I may use in a cover letter. I try not to remove any of them, but
constantly add and edit.


Bullet Points
==============
    - At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probe framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year.
    - As a tech lead, my influence grew, and I was able to utilize my strategic
      abilities and understanding of linux kernel development to decrease
      release time in GCP from a matter of years to weeks.
    - Working on a product as large and diverse as GCP, I took pride in my
      ability to balance the needs of multiple teams.
    - My quick promotion at google, because of my initiative
    - A complex novel compiler extension, stemming from my understanding of
      both functional languages, logic, and algorithmic thinking
    - Working at an at-scale company, comfortable in the language of
      distributed systems, large-scale backends, and data services
    - I'm proud of my blog, showing myself to be both a life-long learner, as
      well as an exceptional communicator
    - My background in mathematics, and comfort in the world of Data Science.
      Combine that with my engineering experience, and you have the makings of
      an exceptional engineer to be employed at a data-first company.
    - My background in Mathematics and algorithems, meaning I have a better
      understanding of many data science tools that your average bear.
    - I'm proud to have been a technical lead, directly managing and mentoring
      junior developers. I enjoy being a team multiplier, and not just an
      individual contributor
    - Working on virtualization kernels at GCP put me in an interesting
      position. On one hand, I had to understand and leverage a large,
      massively distributed system, built up of many micro-services. On the
      other, I needed to dive into low-level, single node code bases. I like to
      think of myself of an engineer who can do both.
    - One of the biggest value-adds I've been responsible for wasn't actually
      code I made for my products at Google, but taking the initiative to build
      Data pipelines to analyze usage and release statistics. Finding the data
      available, and building true knowledge from that data, I have found,
      makes a huge impact on teams abilities to make true strategic decisions.
    - I'm particularly proud of my work at the Observatory, which required me
      to work closely with instrument engineers, astrophysicists, and optics
      specialists. It was necessary for me to quickly bring myself to speed in
      a multi-disciplinary field to design the control and imaging software for
      NESSI (a spectroscopy instrument). I expect working at a small company
      dealing with physical producs such as batteries would require a similar
      skill.
    - I think my path towards leadership has long been established. From being
      the ACM chapter president and student curricula developer in my
      undergrad, being given self direction on my research in Los Alamos, all
      the way to being a technical lead at Google, every position I've ever
      held, I've found myself growing into leadership in the roll.
    - In my time away from engineering, I've been employed as a high school
      math tutor. I've found this to be an amazingly satisfying way to give
      back to my community, and it's part of how I've realized just how
      important being at a mission-oriented organization is to me.
    - Though I have limited career time spent in Data Science (with the
      exception of small data studies here and there), my education included
      courses such as Data Mining, Big Data, Databases, Mathematical Modeling,
      and beyond.
    - Beyond my time as an engineer, I've always been a life-long learner. My
      blog often goes into my passion of linguistics (especially the
      syntactic-semantic interface), I've been involved in study and design of
      advanced programming languages as well as type-driven theorem proves, and
      have a side hustle as a fitness scientist.
    - Being mission oriented, to me, means tackling problems that really
      matter. To me, nothing matters more than the climate crisis. I want to be
      working at the forefront of this battle. I also thrive working face to
      face, and seeing the ways my work actually effects others. Throughout my
      careers, it has been that face-to-face time I've found most rewarding.
      For example, the peer bonuses I've received at Google for developing
      stateless, FP inspired configuration systems for the GCP networking stack
      made me really feel like I was making others (my fellow engineers) lives
      better. I want to chase that feeling.
    - I find communication to be a strength of mine. While developing a release
      strategy for the GCP's linux kernel, it was important to write
      audience-aware design artifacts for a cross-section of invested parties,
      communicating high-level rollout policies, all the way down to indevidual
      git-branch merging strategies, and analyze and communicate the advantages
      and risks being taken on by all teams.

    - Technical skills.
    - Job specific skills
    - I thrive in ambiguity. At Los Alamos I was trusted to independently
      design a novel compiler extension, creating a project direction rather
      than being given one. The product enabled optimization of the parallel
      semantics tools like Tensor Flow use.
    - I can apply both theoretical understanding of algorithms (such as those
      used in ML and NLP), as well as low-level understanding of how they run
      on metal.
    - Blogging, data science
    - Polyhedral optimization, FP,
    - Thrive in ambig
    - On my research blog, \cite{I have written on statistics}
      {https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020-05-10-bessel.html} in both theoretical
      and applied contexts.
    - At Los Alamos and ICASA, I raised the impact of our team's work via
      academic research; for example, my investigations in Polyhedral
      Optimizations changed the direction of our compiler extension.
    - Having taken courses on Prob and Stats, Linear Algebra, Modeling, Machine
      Learning, Data Mining, and Numerical Science, I'm excited to apply these
      skills to innovations like the Transformer Language Models being used at
      Grammarly.
    - I'm excited about environmental impact.
    - I see myself as become a profissent engineer, working in technology X.
    - I am excited to work in a position so close to Data, and am curious about
      slowing growing my Data Science chops.
