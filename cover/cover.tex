  To the 10x Genomics Hiring Staff \par \bigskip

  I'm an experienced Software Engineer, known for initiative and my sense of
  design, and am always finding ways to put my multi-disciplinary background to
  use. I'm searching for a place where my skills can positively impact society,
  which is why the position at 10x Genomics caught my eye --- I would be
  honored to play a part in the enterprise of biological research. With my
  strong CS fundamentals, deep Linux-based programming experience, and passion
  for craft, I think we just might have a match!\medskip

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring a high level of expertise
  in writing efficient, maintainable, and testable production-quality code.
  \smallskip

  \begin{itemize}

    \item I developed test frameworks for the Google Cloud Platform. With a
      complex heterogeneous architecture, a holistic understanding of systems
      was required to make that happen, from the kernel, to the software
      defined network, and beyond.

    \item My personal C compiler project as well as research at a national
      laboratory touch a wide set of topics in CS, applying both theoretical
      knowledge of algorithms, as well as a low-level understanding of how they
      run on metal.

     \item I earned a Peer Bonus for the design of stateless configuration
       tools, inspired by my specialization in functional languages; something
       I've translated into a stack-independent appreciation for the craft of
       software.

    \item My experience is Linux-centric, often utilizing experience in systems
      programing, operating system design, and computer architecture.

  \end{itemzie}\smallskip

  \hl{My sense of Design and Initiative} have defined me and my work, beyond
  just technical skills. Independently identifying problems, leading project
  directions, and communicating across teams has consistently magnified the
  impact I've made.\smallskip

  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probe-test framework (as well as my coding
      skills) earned me a promotion before my first year.

    \item I thrive in ambiguity. At Los Alamos I was trusted to independently
      design a novel compiler extension, creating a project direction rather
      than being given one.

    % \item While an undergraduate, I designed much of the curriculum for first
    %   and second year CS students, served as ACM chapter president, and even
    %   took it upon myself to teach courses on Formal Verification and Type
    %   Theory when non were offered.

  \end{itemize}\smallskip


  \hl{With a Multidisciplinary Background}, having studied both Mathematics and
  Linguistics, I shine in highly-collaborative, learning-oriented settings,
  have worked in diverse fields, and often find ways to bring seemingly
  unrelated skills together.\smallskip

  \begin{itemize}

    \item I actively maintain a research blog, \url{tylercecil.com}, where I
      write on Computation, Mathematical Logic, and Linguistics, striving to
      communicate complex ideas in simple ways.

    \item At Los Alamos and ICASA, I raised the impact of our team's work via
      academic research; for example, my investigations in Polyhedral
      Optimizations changed the direction of our compiler extension.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  I would love an opportunity to discuss how I might contribute to 10x
  Genomics' mission to accelerate the mastery of biology to advance human
  health. Please reach out to me, and we can schedule a call!  \bigskip

  Thank you so much for your time.
