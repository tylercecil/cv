  To whom it may concern\par \bigskip

  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, long on a trajectory of leadership,
  known for exceptional technical knowledge, and an advanced background in
  Mathematics, who's capable of wearing multiple hats.
  % Make this next sentence explain that this is a hard thing to fulfill.
  It's now my mission to apply those skills to the global climate crisis. So
  when I saw the position of "\emph{JOB TITLE}" at \emph{COMPANY} on
  Climatebase, I jumped. I think I see a match. \medskip
  % "Allow me to tell you" sentence?

  % 1. I want to get an interview
  % 2. I want to stand out
  % 3. I want to argue that I have the necessary skills
  % 4. I want to argue I bring things other candidates don't.
  % I want to say "I can wear multiple hats" and "for a young company, that
  % means I can do more and make a bigger impact.
  %
  % Do I ever want to say "I don't need to read my resume to you --- instead I
  % want to tell you a story about how I think I am the candidate for you"

  \hl{As an experienced Senior Engineer}, I bring a high level of software
  architecture and design know-how, excel in strategic-level thinking, while
  still possessing expert code skills, having always worked in fast-paced,
  highly-collaborative settings.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probe framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year.
      % Add something technical here
    \item As a tech lead, I spearheaded a project using my understanding of
      Linux kernel development, which decreased release time from months to
      weeks.
    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      algorithmic code to SQL data-pipelines, an at-scale project like GCP has
      meant zooming in as well as out. I like to think Senior Engineer means
      "able to do both."
      % Maybe on the chopping block?
    % \item I'm proud to have been a technical lead, directly managing and
    %   mentoring junior developers. I enjoy being a team multiplier, and not
    %   just an individual contributor
      % Consider something that says "Senior Engineering"
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My multidisciplinary background} has always found ways into my work,
  enabling me to take on many roles at once and quickly bring myself up to
  speed --- skills which are vital at small fledgeling companies.
  \begin{itemize}
    % \item Blog post
    % \item Pipeline impact
    % \item Multidisciplinary job
    % \item Thrive in Ambig

    %   "Combine that with my engineering experience, and
    %   you have the makings of an exceptional engineer to be employed at a
    %   data-first company."

    \item My research blog \cite{dives into
      statistics}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html}, one of
      my biggest value-adds. Comfortable with the tools of Data Science, I was
      about to build a pipeline translating release, usage, and profiling
      statistics into real knowledge at Google Cloud.

    \item Working at an Observatory required collaborating with instrument
      engineers, astrophysicists, and optics specialists. Quickly adapting to
      domains outside my own were necessary to develop the control and imaging
      software for NESSI.
      % I expect working at a small company
      % dealing with physical devices would require a similar skill.

    \item I thrive in ambiguity. At Los Alamos I was trusted to independently
      design a novel compiler extension, based on my experience with functional
      languages an research on Polyhedral Optimization, creating a project
      direction rather than being given one. The product enabled optimization
      of the parallel semantics tools like Tensor Flow use.
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Making a pivot to the environment} is an important career change for me,
  and I see COMPANY as a place where I can do that --- somewhere I can be
  motivated by my positive impact and grow as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Working at a mission-oriented organization is incredibly important
      to me, as I learned during my time away from engineering, spent as a
      high school tutor.

    \item I want to be at the forefront of climate solutions, tackling problems
      that really matter. THE WORK AT COMPANY WORKS WITH ME

    \item I'm excited to work at a data-first company, and hope to grow not
      just as an engineer, but to begin to specialize more in Data. I SEE STUFF
      AT COMPANY.
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  %  I am not a traditional applicant for this position; I have an eclectic
  %  background, rather than narrow experience with Scikit-Learn or XGBoost.  But
  %  there's a reason I want Grammarly, and why Grammarly might want me. I care
  %  about making language and communication more accessible to everybody. I can
  %  bring more Engineering expertise than your average Data Scientist. I have a
  %  stronger Mathematical maturity than your average Engineer. Combine that with
  %  my love of Linguistics, and you're left with a unique and strong candidate.
  %  \medskip

  I would love the opportunity to discuss the impact I could have on
  \emph{COMPANY's} mission of \emph{MISSION}. Please reach out to me, and we
  can schedule a call!  \bigskip
