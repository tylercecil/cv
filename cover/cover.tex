  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with a strong background in
  Mathematics, making it my mission to apply my skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a position which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions is a rarity, so I jumped when I saw
  the post for "Energy Data Scientist" at EnergyHub. Though it might be a
  pivot, I'm here to say I think we have a match! \medbreak

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring a high level of production
  level coding, design, and best practice know-how, beyond that of an average
  data scientist, all while providing the strong leadership and initiative
  needed in a fast-paced collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item I excel not just with technology, but with strategy. As a tech lead,
      experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel development)
      allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased our release time from
      over a year to under a month.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      optimization algorithms to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale
      product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think
      `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  \hl{My background in Mathematics} transfers easily to data science, modeling,
  optimization, and ML, allowing me to navigate research settings and quickly
  ramp up in new fields.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics experts. That adaptability will be key working across
      research and engineering boundaries.

    \item Having taken courses on Stats, Numerical Science, Modeling, and ML,
      I'm excited to apply my training and really specialize in data science
      --- especially energy data!

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at EnergyHub, motivated by a positive impact
  and growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Using tools like \href{http://gridstatus.io}{GridStatus.io}, I've
      been to studying wholesale energy markets, dreaming of a career in
      clean-energy. Your work with DERs and VPPs seems a complex project I
      would be proud and excited to be part of.

    \item I'm also eager to specialize in Data Science, where I can amplify the
      impact I'll have on our planet. So many climate solutions are
      data-centric, and I want to use my math knowledge to tackle these
      problems.

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  So, do we have a match? It's clear from my resume that I'm an exceptional
  engineer. It's clear from your mission that EnergyHub aligns with my values.
  With my strong mathematics training and career ambitions, Energy Data
  Scientist really sparks something for me. Of course it's a pivot, but I'm not
  just another candidate; I'm a strong leader, a versatile problem solver, and
  have a uniquely adaptable background. Given the opportunity I am confident I
  can make real impact. \medbreak

  I am genuinely excited to connect and discuss the potential role I could play
  in EnergyHub's mission to create a clean, distributed energy future.
