  To Whom It May Concern, \par \bigbreak

  % Lean into generalism
  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with a strong background in
  Mathematics, making it my mission to apply these skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a position which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions has felt a rarity. That's why I was
  grabbed by the post at \emph{Sealed} on Climatebase. If you're looking for an
  engineer able to deliver in a dynamic environment, excited to make a real
  impact on our planet, then here I am to say we might have a match!\medbreak

  % What I'm good at as an engineer. Focus on a diverse set of skills
  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring both a high level of
  production software architecture and design know-how as well as expert coding
  skills, all while providing the strong leadership and strategic thinking
  needed in a fast-paced collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probing framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year. % chopping block

    \item I excel not just with technology, but with strategy. As a tech lead,
      experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel development)
      allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased our release time from
      over a year to under a month.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      optimization algorithms to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale
      product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think
      `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  % Math is a unique twist on me, and I'm very set up for the data part of this
  % interesting project. I might not be a GIS expert, but I can bring a lot
  % quickly
  \hl{My degree in Mathematics} makes me more than just an engineer; I'm versed
  in data science, modeling, and ML, and able to quickly navigate research in
  new fields like residential energy usage.

  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics experts. That same adaptability will be key working in a new
      niche field, collaborating with engineering, product, operations, and
      policy teams.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at Sealed, motivated by a positive impact
  and growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item I'm eager to build a career specialization in the climate. Your work
      in residential energy and public policy seems both complex and a project
      I would feel proud and excited to be part of.

    \item Using tools like \href{http://gridwatch.io}{GridStatus.io}, I've been
      to studying the mechanics of energy markets. I've been shocked to learn
      just how much a role residential energy loss plays in our current energy
      equation.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  So is it a match? It's clear from my resume that I'm an exceptionally
  qualified engineer. It's clear from your mission that Sealed aligns with my
  values. Add in my diverse background and specific career ambitions, and it's
  clear I'm not just another candidate; given the opportunity, I am confident I
  can make real impact. \medskip

  I am genuinely excited to connect and
  discuss the role I could play in Sealed's mission stopping home energy waste
  and electrifying all homes.
