  To Whom It May Concern, \par \bigbreak

  % I need to shift focus onto "Engineer", with an interesting twist of Math
  % Thesis: I'm a Senior-level engineer, with the added depth of math, who
  % wants to be in climate Looking for a place which lets me bring all my
  % skills while still being rooted in my values Looks like we might have a
  % fit!
  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with a strong background in
  Mathematics, making it my mission to apply these skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a position which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions has felt a rarity. That's why I was
  grabbed by the post at \emph{Voltus} on Climatebase. You're looking for an
  Engineer who thinks in terms of systems, excited to empower a clean-energy
  revolution? Well here I am to say I think we have a match! \medbreak

  % Extremely competent and versatile engineer
  % - Worked as a technical lead
  % - Diverse skillsets, really able to dig down
  % - Known for initiative
  % - Bring not just deep technical know-how, but high-level strategy
  % - Systems engineering
  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring both a high level of
  production software architecture and design know-how as well as expert coding
  skills, all while providing the strong leadership and strategic thinking
  needed in a fast-paced collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probing framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year. % chopping block

    \item I excel not just with technology, but with strategy. As a tech lead,
      experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel development)
      allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased our release time from
      over a year to under a month.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      optimization algorithms to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale
      product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think
      `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  % My mathematics background adds an extra depth to me as an engineer, more
  % versed in data science, modeling, and ML. I'm always looking for ways to
  % bring this experience to my work REALLY need to think about this
  % - Cross-Functional work
  % - Data-science, which will come up in XYZ ways
  % - Technical writing
  \hl{My degree in Mathematics} makes me more than just an engineer; I'm versed
  in data science, modeling, and ML, and able to quickly navigate research in
  new fields like DERs and VPPs, tackling problems holistically.

  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics experts. That same adaptability will be key working across
      boundaries with energy market analysts, battery experts, and data
      scientists.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  % This is a great section for this particular post
  % - Want to pivot into energy in particular
  % - Am deeply mission oriented
  % - Want to grow as a developer within this space, building up a
  %   specialization.
  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at Voltus, motivated by a positive impact
  and growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item I'm eager to build a career specialization in clean-energy. Your work
      with DERs seems both complex and a project I would feel proud and excited
      to be part of.

    \item Using tools like
      \href{http://gridwatch.io}{GridStatus.io}, I've been
      to studying the mechanics of wholesale energy markets, dreaming of a
      career at the forefront of climate solutions.

    \item Seeing you value awareness, empathy, intentionality, and curiosity
      fills me with confidence that this is a team I want to be part of and
      contribute to.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  So is it a match? It's clear from my resume that I'm an exceptionally
  qualified engineer. It's clear from your mission that Voltus aligns with my
  values. Add in my diverse background and specific career ambitions, and it's
  clear I'm not just another candidate; given the opportunity, I am confident I
  can make real impact. \medskip

  I am genuinely excited to connect and
  discuss the role I could play in Voltus's mission becoming \emph{the}
  Distributed Energy Platform, realizing our energy transition.
