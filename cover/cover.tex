  To Whom It May Concern, \par \bigbreak

  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with a strong background in
  Mathematics, making it my mission to apply these skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a position which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions is a rarity. That's why I was grabbed
  by the post at \emph{Granular} on Climatebase. You're looking for an Engineer
  with an analytical bend who can make an impact on the clean-energy
  revolution? Well here I am to say I think we have a match! \medbreak

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring both a high level of
  production software architecture and design know-how as well as expert coding
  skills, all while providing the strong leadership and strategic thinking
  needed in a fast-paced collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item I excel not just with technology, but with strategy. As a tech lead,
      experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel development)
      allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased our release time from
      over a year to under a month.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      optimization algorithms to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale
      product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think
      `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My degree in Mathematics} makes me more than just an engineer; I'm versed
  in data science, modeling, and ML, and able to quickly navigate research in
  new fields like clean energy commodities, tackling problems holistically.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics experts. That same adaptability will be key working across
      boundaries with market analysts, energy experts, and data scientists.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at Granular, motivated by a positive impact and
  growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Using tools like \href{http://gridwatch.io}{GridStatus.io}, I've been
      spending time studying the mechanics of wholesale energy markets,
      dreaming of a career in clean-energy.

    \item I'm eager to build a career specialization in clean-energy. Your
      energy certificate trading platform seems a complex project which I would
      be proud and excited to be part of.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  So is it a match? It's clear from my resume that I'm an exceptionally
  qualified engineer. It's clear from your mission that Granular aligns with my
  values. Add in my diverse background and specific career ambitions, and it's
  clear I'm not just another candidate; given the opportunity, I am confident I
  can make real impact. \medskip

  I am genuinely excited to connect and discuss the role I could play in
  Granular's mission to create a future powered by clean energy.
