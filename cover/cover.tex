\makeheader{For the position of "Senior Software Engineer" at Gridmatic}

  To whom it may concern, \par \bigskip

  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with a strong background in
  mathematics, making it my mission to apply these skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a position which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions has felt a rarity, so I was grabbed by
  the post at \emph{Gridmatic} on Climatebase. I have a feeling this might be a
  match for both of us. \medbreak

  \hl{As an experienced Senior Engineer}, I bring both a high level of software
  architecture and design know-how as well as expert coding skills, all while
  providing the strong leadership and strategic thinking needed in a fast-paced
  start-up setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probing framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year.

    \item I excel not just with technology, but with strategy. As a tech lead,
      experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel development)
      allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased our release time from
      over a year to under a month.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      algorithmic code to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale product
      like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think `Senior
      Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My degree in Mathematics} allows me to engage in data science and machine
  learning, quickly ramp up in new fields of research, and act as more than
  just engineer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics experts. That same adaptability will be key working with the
      energy market and ML researchers.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at Gridmatic, motivated by a positive impact
  and growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item I want to be at the forefront of climate solutions. Reading your 2022
      ERCOT Storage Report convinced me that Gridmatic can provide the chance
      to do just that.

    \item I'm excited to work at a data-first company. I see a role where I can
      use my backend engineering experience, grow towards a data
      specialization, all while solving problems that really matter.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  % Where experience, leadership, and passion for climate solutions are
  % paramount, I am not just another candidate with a qualified resume; I am a
  % versatile problem solver, technically skilled and adaptable, poised to drive
  % real change fast.


  % - Sizzler
  % - Qualified Engineer, ready to apply my math, excited about the mission
  It's clear from my resume I'm an exceptionally qualified engineer, my math
  background adds an extra dimension of value, and I have a clear personal
  mission, leaving me poised to drive real change fast. Given the opportunity,
  I am confident I will not only meet your expectations but exceed them. I am
  genuinely excited to connect and discuss the impact I could have on
  Gridmatics's mission increasing the adoption of clean energy everywhere.
