  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with an advanced background in
  Mathematics, making it my mission to apply my skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a place which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions has felt a rarity. That's why I was so
  grabbed by the post for "Simulation Software Engineer" at Zitara. It might be
  a pivot, but I see you looking for an exceptional engineer with the know-how
  necessary to really drive scientific code and effectively work
  cross-functionally --- well I'm here to say we might have a match! \medbreak

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring a high level of production
  level coding, design, and best practice know-how, beyond that of a research
  or data scientist, all while providing the strong leadership and initiative
  needed in a fast-paced start-up setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item I excel not just with technology, but with strategy. As a tech lead,
      experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel development)
      allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased our release time from
      over a year to under a month.

    \item From C to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      optimization algorithms to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale
      product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think
      `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  \hl{My background in Mathematics} applies easily to modeling, numerical
  methods, and ML, allowing me to navigate research settings and quickly ramp
  up in new fields.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics experts. That same adaptability will be key working across
      the battery research and engineering boundary.

    \item Having taken courses on Stats, Numerical Science, Modeling, and ML,
      I'm excited to apply my training towards a cutting-edge battery
      simulation platform.

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at Zitara, motivated by a positive impact
  and growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Using tools like \href{http://gridwatch.io}{GridStatus.io}, I've been
      to studying the mechanics of wholesale energy markets, gaining a deeper
      understanding of the roles batteries play on our grid.

    \item I'm eager to be at the forefront of not just climate, but also data
      and simulation, specializing more in the skills that will amplify the
      impact I can have on our world!

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  So, is it a match? It's clear from my resume that I'm an exceptional
  engineer. It's clear from your mission that Zitara aligns with my
  values. With my strong mathematics training and career ambitions, simulation
  software really sparks something for me. Of course it's a pivot, but I'm not
  just another candidate; I'm a strong leader, a versatile problem solver, and
  have a uniquely adaptable background. Given an opportunity like this or
  similar, I am confident I can make real impact. \medbreak

  I am genuinely excited to connect and discuss the potential role I could play
  in Zitara's journey championing better battery management for a decarbonizing
  world.
