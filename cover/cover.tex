\makeheader{For the position of "Software Engineer" at Liminal}

\begin{adjustwidth}{38pt}{38pt}

  To whom it may concern\par \bigskip

  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, long on a trajectory of leadership,
  known for exceptional technical knowledge with a strong background in math,
  who's capable wearing multiple hats. I'm making it my mission to apply these
  skills to the global climate crisis. Finding a position which suits my
  abilities and mission equally isn't always simple, so when I saw the post on
  Climate base for "\emph{Software Engineer}" at \emph{Liminal}, reimagining
  battery manufacturing, I jumped! I think this could be a match for both of
  us! \medskip

  \hl{As an experienced Senior Engineer}, I bring both a high level of software
  architecture and design know-how as well as expert coding skills, all while
  providing the strong leadership and strategic thinking needed in a fast-paced
  collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probing framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year.

    \item As a tech lead, experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and
      kernel development) allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased
      release time from over a year to under a month. A young startup like
      Liminal can use that combination of technical and strategic ability.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level IoT hardware to massive cloud
      micro-service architectures, SQL data-pipelines to Javascript UIs,
      working at an at-scale product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and}
      out. I like to think `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My multidisciplinary background} has always found ways into my work,
  enabling me to take on many roles at once and quickly bring myself up to
  speed --- skills which are vital for a small fledgeling company.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Working on hardware at an observatory required collaboration with
      astrophysicists and optics engineers. Rapidly adapting to domains beyond
      my own was critical developing telescope software, and I expect working
      on on-prem metrology instrumentation would be similar.

    \item My research blog \cite{dives into
      statistics}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html}, one of
      my major value-adds. Comfortable with data science, I built a pipeline
      translating release and profiling statistics into real knowledge at
      Google. With Liminal's values of curiosity (and Machine Learning), I
      think I'll fit right in.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  % TO FIX
  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me,
  and I see Liminal as a place where I can do that --- somewhere I will be
  motivated by a positive impact and grow as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item I want to be at the forefront of climate solutions, and Liminal's
      work on \emph{EchoStat} and battery manufacturing seem a key part of our
      energy transition --- something I would be proud to be part of.

    \item I'm also excited to work at an technology company, where I can grow
      as an engineer. I see a role which will expose me to both industrial
      software, and enable me to work alongside data scientists, gaining skills
      and helping solve problems which really matter.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  % TO FIX
  Where experience, leadership, and passion for climate solutions are
  paramount, I am not just another candidate with a qualified resume; I am a
  versatile problem solver, technically skilled and adaptable, poised to drive
  real change fast. Given the opportunity, I am confident I will not only meet
  your expectations but exceed them. I am genuinely excited to discuss the
  impact I could have on Liminal's journey empowering a global EV future.
