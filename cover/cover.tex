  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with a strong background in
  Mathematics, making it my mission to apply my skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a place which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions has felt a rarity. That's why I was so
  grabbed by the post for "Research Software Engineer" at Equilibrium. You
  asked for a letter describing my dream position --- well here I am to say I
  think we might have a match. \medbreak

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring a high level of production
  level coding, design, and best practice know-how, beyond that of a research
  or data scientist, all while providing the strong leadership and initiative
  needed in a fast-paced collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item The intersection of leadership and development is where I thrive. As
      a tech lead, experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel
      development) allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased release
      time from over a year to under a month.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      algorithmic code to SQL and ORM data-pipelines, working at an at-scale
      product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think
      `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.
  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  \hl{My background in Mathematics} transfers easily to modeling, optimization,
  and ML, allowing me to navigate research settings and quickly ramp up in new
  fields.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics engineers. That same adaptability will be key working across
      the energy research and engineering boundary.

    \item Having taken courses on Stats, Numerical Science, Modeling, Machine
      Learning, I'm excited to apply my training toward developing a
      utility-scale battery simulation platform.

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at Equilibrium, motivated by a positive impact
  and growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Creating actionable insights from energy and market simulation is a
      project I would feel proud and excited to be part of, working at the
      forefront of climate solutions.

    \item I'm also eager to work at a data-intensive company, where I can
      specialize more in Data Science, Optimization, and ML, amplifying the
      impact I can have on our planet.

  \end{itemize} \medbreak

  So, what is my dream position? It's clear from my resume that I'm an
  exceptional engineer. It's clear from your mission that Equilibrium aligns
  with my values. With my strong mathematics training and career ambitions, and
  research software really sparks something for me. Of course it's a pivot, but
  I'm not just another candidate; I'm a strong leader, a versatile problem
  solver, and have a uniquely adaptable background. Given the opportunity, I am
  poised to make real impact fast. \medbreak

  I am genuinely excited to connect and discuss the potential role I could play
  in Equilibrium's journey building a climate generation power company.
