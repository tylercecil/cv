  To whom it may concern\par \bigskip

  I'm an experienced Software Engineer looking for something new --- something
  aligned with my values, human-focused, where I can help others directly, and
  Education might be it! AJ Tutoring would mean stepping into this career path,
  not a stopgap position, and I hope to make a real impact on students while
  I'm at it! While this would be a pivot, I believe I bring more than just my
  enthusiasm. I have both formal and informal teaching and tutoring experience,
  a strong academic background (in STEM topics and beyond), and the skills of
  an Engineer. I would love the opportunity to start my journey into education
  at AJ Tutoring.

  \medskip

  \hl{My experiences teaching and tutoring}, both in formal and informal
  settings, were what first hinted that education might be for me.
  \smallskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Serving as the head TA during Undergrad, I held 1:1 and group
      tutoring sessions, developed course materials, as well as actually
      instructed a number of courses.
    \item As the eldest of five, tutoring has been a family responsibility of
      mine --- especially for my siblings with learning disabilities.
    \item This means I've worked with students ranging from middle school to
      undergraduates, and feel comfortable helping many age groups.
    % \item My blog is *very* expository
    % Much much more about passion and excitement
  \end{itemize}
  \smallskip

  \hl{With a strong and varied academic background} I can quickly be an
  effective tutor in wide range of topics, given prep-time.
  \smallskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item With degrees in Math and CS, I have exceptionally strong STEM
      fundamentals.
      % Talk about eclecticism
    \item I also have a background in Linguistics, and have strong writing
      skills that I love to pass on.
    \item More important than what I know, is how I explain it. I take pride in
      my ability to react and really help students understand in a way tailored
      to them.
    \item Beyond topic areas, I can offer mentorship with study skills. My
      family experience with students who, for one reason or another struggle,
      as well as my personal experience as a dyslexic arm me with both patience
      as well as solutions.
  \end{itemize}
  \smallskip

  % So what is my POINT in this section?
  % I think I want to say that "I also believe that believe that being and
  % Engineer brings something unique"
  \hl{An Engineering background brings something unique}, I think, to this
  position. Not just STEM knowledge, but exceptional communication skills, and
  the mentorship my industry experience affords me.
  \smallskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Communicated complex ideas in simple and understandable ways is
      perhaps the most important skill an engineer can have. This is directly
      applicable to education.
    \item Many students may be interested in such career paths, and having a
      former Google engineer as their personal tutor could be of value to them.
  \end{itemize}
  \medskip

  I would love an opportunity to discuss how I might help unlock student
  potential at AJ Tutoring! I can commit to both the minimum weekly hours, as
  well as working to the end of the academic year. Please reach out to me, and
  we can schedule a call!

  Thank you so much for your time.
