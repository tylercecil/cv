  I'm an experienced Software Engineer curious about moving into Education.
  I've been looking for something different --- something aligned with my
  values, human-focused, where I can directly help others.
  % To me, tutoring would mean stepping into that career path, not a stopgap
  % position, and making a real impact on students while I'm at it!
  Though a pivot, I believe I bring more than just enthusiasm! I have both
  formal and informal teaching and tutoring experience, a strong academic
  foundation (in STEM topics and beyond), and all the unique qualities my
  professional background affords. I would love the opportunity to start this
  journey into education at AJ Tutoring!
  \medskip

  \hl{My experience teaching and tutoring}, both in formal and informal
  settings, were my first hints that education might be for me.
  \smallskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Serving as the head TA during undergrad, I held 1:1 and group
      tutoring sessions, developed course materials, as well as instructed a
      number of courses.
    \item As the eldest of five, tutoring has been a family responsibility of
      mine --- especially for my siblings with learning disabilities.
    \item I've worked with students ranging from middle school to
      undergraduates, and feel comfortable helping many age groups.
    % Possibly a note about blog, or enjoying the act
  \end{itemize}
  \smallskip

  \hl{With a strong and varied academic background} I can quickly be an
  effective tutor in wide range of topics, given prep-time.
  \smallskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item With degrees in Math and CS, I have exceptionally strong STEM
      fundamentals.
    \item My background also includes Linguistics, strong writing faculties,
      and a love for the humanities.
    \item More important than what I know, is how I explain it. I take pride in
      my ability to react and tailor my explanations to students.
    \item I can offer mentorship with study skills. Experience with students
      who struggle and my personal experience as a dyslexic arm me with both
      patience as well as solutions.
  \end{itemize}
  \smallskip

  \hl{An Engineering background brings something unique} to this position. Not
  just STEM knowledge, but exceptional communication skills, and professional
  mentorship.\smallskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Communicating complex ideas in simple and understandable ways was a
      critical responsibility for me Google, and I hope to apply that to
      education.
    \item Many students may be interested in such career paths, and having a
      former Google engineer as their personal tutor could be of value to them.
  \end{itemize}
  \medskip

  I would love an opportunity to discuss how I might help unlock student
  potential at AJ Tutoring! I can commit to both the minimum weekly hours, as
  well as working to the end of the academic year. Please reach out to me, and
  we can schedule a call or meeting to discuss this opportunity!
