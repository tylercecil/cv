\makeheader{For the position of Python Engineer at Ascend Analytics}

  To Whom It May Concern, \par \bigbreak

  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, with a strong background in
  Mathematics, making it my mission to apply these skills to the global climate
  crisis. Finding a position which fully utilizes my unique abilities while
  pushing forward real climate solutions has felt a rarity. That's why I was
  grabbed by the post at \emph{Ascend} on Climatebase. You're looking for an
  Engineer who can empower analytics for the clean-tech power revolution? Well
  here I am to say I think we have a match! \medbreak

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring both a high level of
  production software architecture and design know-how as well as expert coding
  skills, all while providing the strong leadership and strategic thinking
  needed in a fast-paced collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probing framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year. % chopping block

    \item I excel not just with technology, but with strategy. As a tech lead,
      experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and kernel development)
      allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased our release time from
      over a year to under a month.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      optimization algorithmic to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale
      product like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think
      `Senior Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My degree in Mathematics} transfers easily to data science, modeling, and
  ML, allowing me to quickly navigate research in new fields, and act as more
  than just engineer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item On my research blog you'll find \cite{Jupyter
      notebooks}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html} on
      statistics, showing not just some data-science credentials, but my
      technical communication ability.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics experts. That same adaptability will be key working across
      boundaries with energy market analysts, data scientists, and engineers.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me, and
  one I can see myself making at Ascend, motivated by a positive impact
  and growing as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Creating actionable insights from energy markets is a project I would
      feel proud and excited to be part of, working at the forefront of climate
      solutions.

    \item Using tools like \href{http://gridwatch.io}{GridStatus.io}, I've been
      to studying the mechanics of wholesale energy markets. Folding this
      personal interest into my career feels a dream.

    \item I'm also eager to work at a data-intensive company, where I can
      specialize more in data analysis, amplifying the impact I can have on our
      planet.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  So is it a match? It's clear from my resume that I'm an exceptionally
  qualified engineer. It's clear from your mission that Ascend aligns with my
  values. Add in my strong mathematics background and career ambitions, and
  it's clear I'm not just another candidate; given the opportunity, I am
  confident I can make real impact. \medskip

  I am genuinely excited to connect and
  discuss the role I could play in Ascend's mission creating the actionable
  intelligence necessary to realize our energy transition.
