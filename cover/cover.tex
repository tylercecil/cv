\makeheader{For the position of "Senior Backend Engineer" at Zitara}

\begin{adjustwidth}{38pt}{38pt}

  To whom it may concern\par \bigskip

  I'm a Senior-level Software Engineer, long on a trajectory of leadership,
  known for exceptional technical knowledge and a strong background in math,
  and who's capable wearing multiple hats. I'm making it my mission to apply
  those skills to the global climate crisis. Finding a position which suits my
  abilities and mission equally isn't always simple, so when I saw the post for
  "\emph{Senior Software Engineer}" at \emph{Zitara} on Climatebase, I jumped!
  I think this could be a match for both of us! \medskip

  \hl{As an experienced Senior Engineer}, I bring both a high level of software
  architecture and design know-how as well as expert coding skills, all while
  providing the strong leadership and strategic thinking needed in a fast-paced
  collaborative setting.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probing framework earned me a promotion before my
      first year.

    \item As a tech lead, experience with multi-stakeholder projects (and
      kernel development) allowed me to spearhead an effort which decreased
      release time from over a year to under a month. A Series-A startup like
      Zitara can use that combination of technical and strategic ability.

    \item From C++ to Python, low-level to massive micro-service architectures,
      algorithmic code to SQL data-pipelines, working at an at-scale product
      like GCP has meant zooming in \emph{and} out. I like to think `Senior
      Engineer' means I can do both.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My multidisciplinary background} has always found ways into my work,
  enabling me to take on many roles at once and quickly bring myself up to
  speed --- skills which are vital for a small fledgeling company.
  \begin{itemize}

    \item My research blog \cite{dives into
      statistics}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020/05/10/bessel.html}, one of
      my major value-adds. Comfortable with data science, I built a pipeline
      translating release and profiling statistics into real knowledge at
      Google. Zitara, with its complex data platform, needs data-savvy
      engineers like me.

    \item Working at an observatory required collaboration with astrophysicists
      and optics engineers. Quickly adapting to domains beyond my own was
      critical developing telescope software, and I expect it would be similar
      working alongside battery algorithm and ML engineers.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Pivoting to the environment} is an important career change for me,
  and I see Zitara as a place where I can do that --- somewhere I will be
  motivated by a positive impact and grow as a developer.
  \begin{itemize}

      % Possibly on the chopping block
    % \item Working at a mission-oriented organization is incredibly important
    %   to me, as I learned during my time away from engineering, spent as a
    %   high school tutor directly impacting others.

    \item I want to be at the forefront of climate solutions, and Zitara's work
      on State of Charge algorithms and battery data models seem a key part of
      our energy transition --- something I would be proud to be part of.

    \item I'm also excited to work at a data-first company, where I can grow as
      an engineer and specialize more in data platforms. I see a role
      developing software while expanding ones experience with data engineering
      and ML technologies, solving problems that really matter.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  Where experience, leadership, and passion for climate solutions are
  paramount, I am not just another candidate with a qualified resume; I am a
  versatile problem solver, technically skilled and adaptable, poised to drive
  real change fast. I am confident, given the opportunity,  I will not only
  meet your expectations but also exceed them, and am genuinely excited to
  discuss the impact I could have on Zitara's journey improving battery
  operations everywhere. Please reach out to me, and we'll schedule a call!
