  To the 10x Genomics Hiring Staff \par \bigskip

  I'm an experienced Software Engineer with an eclectic background, and I've
  been on the hunt for a position where I can use my skills to directly and
  actively improve the lives of others. The work being done at 10x Genomics, I
  think, does exactly that. \textbf{talk about the fit} \medskip

  % Software engineer with experience. Indeed, I don't have experience in
  % biology, but am extremely comfortable in multi-disciplinary envioronments,
  % and have worked at observatories and national labratories, used to
  % collaborating, supporting scientists. As a developer, I am known for my
  % sense of design and detail, highly tuned towards the bigger picture.  The
  % imapct I think this has is maintainability, scalability, and some third
  % thing. \medskip

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring a high level of expertise
  in writing efficient, maintainable, and testable production-quality code

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Developing test frameworks for the massive-scale Google Cloud
      Platform involved complex parallel architectures, collaboration with
      dozens of domain-specific teams, and insight into end-user use cases.

    \item My experience with Compilers, touches a wide set of topics in
      computer science. I can apply both theoretical understanding of
      algorithms, as well as low-level understanding of how they run on metal.

    \item Functional Programming was an early specializations of mine, which
      I've translated to a stack-independent appreciation for the craft of
      software.

  \end{itemzie}\smallskip

  \hl{My sense of Design and Initiative} have defined me and my work, beyond
  just technical skills. By independently identifying problems, leading project
  directions, and communicating across teams, and I've provided a consistently
  high-impact.

  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Google, my initiative in identifying the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probe-test framework (as well as my coding
      skills) earned me a promotion before my first year.

    \item I thrive in ambiguity. At Los Alamos I was trusted to independently
      design a novel compiler extension, creating a project direction rather
      than being given one.

    \item While an undergraduate, I designed much of the curriculum for first
      and second year CS students, served as ACM chapter president, and even
      took it upon myself to teach courses on Formal Verification and Type
      Theory when non were offered.

  \end{itemize}\smallskip


  \hl{With a multidisciplinary background}, having studied both Mathematics and
  Linguistics, I'm comfortable in highly-collaborative, learning-oriented
  settings, and often find ways to bring seemingly unrelated skills together.

  \begin{itemize}

    \item At Los Alamos and ICASA, I raised the impact of our team's work via
      academic research; for example, my investigations in Polyhedral
      Optimizations changed the direction of our compiler extension.

    \item I actively maintain a research blog, \url{tylercecil.com}, where I
      write on Linguistics, Mathematical Logic, and Computation, striving to
      communicate complex ideas in simple ways.

  \end{itemize} \medskip

  I would love an opportunity to discuss how I might contribute to 10x
  Genomics' mission to accelerate the mastery of biology to advance human
  health. Please reach out to me, and we can schedule a call!  \bigskip

  Thank you so much for your time.
