Have you studied mathematical logic?
====================================
My university did not offer any courses on formal logic. However, I had a
number of other outlets that allowed me to supplement my interests in logic.

In the summer of 2015 I attended the Oregon Programming Language Summer School,
with a focus on "Types, Logic, Semantics, and Verification". The courses
included:
- Proof Theory, with Dr. Frank Pfenning
- Dependent Type Theory, with Dr. Robert Harper
- Category Theory, with Dr. Ed Morehouse
- Inductive and Inductive-Recursive Definitions in Intuitionistic Type Theory,
  with Dr. Peter Dybjer.
- The Coq Proof Assistant, with Dr. Adam Chlipala
- Logical Relations, with Dr. Amal Ahmed.
Here I built a foundation with Sequent Calculus, first and higher-order logics,
the construction of formal systems, and basic semantics of modal and
sub-structural logics as well as dependent type theory. There was also a
strong focus on the Curry Howard Correspondence.

I also self-supplemented my logical studies. As ACM President I ran lecture
series on Gödel's Proofs (only to the detail you would find in Nagel & Newman),
Proof Theory in Coq (following Benjamin Pierce's "Software Foundations"), and
various topics in computation theory. My knowledge of Gödel's theorems covers
only what one would read in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (an
understanding of the Diagonalization Lemma, First and Second Incompleteness
Theorems, Tarski's Theorem, and some philosophical ramifications). I may have
blind-spots in my knowledge, but feel comfortable in the fundamentals.

This leaves me with a somewhat eclectic introductory level of knowledge of
modern logic.

Have you studied basic algebra?
====================================
As a mathematics major, I took Math 455 "Abstract Algebra". The course covered
the basics of Groups, Rings, Fields, up to basic Galois Theory.

This would serve as a foundation in many other courses, both in Mathematics as
well as in Computer Science, most notably including Math 581 "Introduction to
Algebraic Geometry".

Have you studied basic probability theory and statistics?
====================================
As a mathematics major, I took Math 382 "Probability and Statistics". The
course was predominantly application focused, with introductory content
appropriate for science and engineering students, as well as math majors.

As a mathematics major, I later took Math 430 "Mathematical Modeling", focusing
on statistical and machine learning methods of modeling in various domain
spaces.

As a Computer Science major, I took CSE 489 "Data Mining", covering machine
learning methods on large datasets. I undertook two research projects in this
course. The first was a research review on HMMs involved in reconstruction of
Proto-Indo-European phonetics. The second was an of a statistical exploration
of Github projects, measuring their health and popularity.

As a Computer Science major, I took CSE 581 "Machine Learning". This course
shadowed the content of Carnegie Mellon University's Spring 2011 Machine
Learning course by Dr. Tom Mitchell. I undertook a research project in this
course involving statistical methods of Part of Speech Tagging systems.

Have you studied theoretical computer science?
====================================
As a Computer Science major, I took many courses involved in theoretical CS,
including but not limited to CSE 344 "Design & Analysis of Algorithms", CSE 342
"Formal Languages & Automata", and CSE 489 "Advanced Algorithms in CS & IT".
The curriculum covered basic fundamentals of complexity theory, formal
languages, and Turing machines.

Further (as stated in my section on my background in Logic), in 2015 I took
part in the Oregon Programming Language Summer school, with a focus on "Types,
Logic, Semantics, and Verification". I won't re-enumerate the lecture series
here, but this would further strengthen my background in theoretical CS.

As ACM chapter president, I would run a weekly group called "Functional
Programming Coffee". There the Lambda Calculus would be covered extensively,
working through papers such as Barendregt's "Introduction to generalized type
systems".

Have you studied theoretical linguistics?
====================================
Theoretical linguistics: introduction to phonology, morphology, syntax,
semantics.

Unfortunately I have not thoroughly studied theoretical linguistics.

**ultimately no, but**
**semantics**
**morpho-syntax relation**


Indicate which programming languages you have used in the past
====================================
For traditional software development I've used:
Haskell, C/C++, Java, Python, Go Lang

In Mathematic and Scientific capacities I've worked with:
Julia, R, Matlab

In the study of Proof and Type Theory I've worked with:
Coq, Agda

Interest in programming languages has given me experience with other languages,
including Lisps, Standard ML, Prolog...
