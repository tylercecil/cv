<!-- OK, I have now cut my freewriting section down to about 600 words. After
going through everything, I see the sections like so:

1. At Google
2. Before Google
3. After Google

4. My Plan Now
5. UvA

That's not bad. I want 1-3 To be a bit more clear, and explicitly reveal 4.
(as per my original outline). Especially with a mission statement at the top.
I could also use some specifics that I can back up with facts.

And obviously 4-5 are closely linked.

Also I should remove a bit of the "angst" so to speak. Focus on the draws, not
the pushes.

In 2018 I left my job at Google. After being promoted early, and trusted with
design and organizational work, beyond that of an average software developer, I
had finished what I came there to do: gain experience, collect capital, and get
a taste for what working in industry is like. This last point was very
important to me.

Before Google, I attended a small university, receiving degrees in Mathematics
and Computer Science. Though not the best student on paper, qualitatively I
excelled. I routinely set the curve on examinations, demonstrating subject
mastery. I was heavily involved in teaching, TAing many courses, managing other
TAs, writing course materials, and making proposals to the department for
curriculum changes. I was the goto person on campus for the topics I identified
with.

Those topics were rooted in theoretical CS and formal logic. Functional
programing led me to type theory, type theory to proof theory, proof theory to
constructive logic, category theory, recursion theory, semantics, and so on.
None of these topics were actually offered at my university, but I have always
been comfortable being an autodidact, and supplemented my own education.

I took part in the Oregon Programming Language Summer School. Beyond the
excitement of being exposed to topics I could never get back at my home
university, it stood out to me that all the students, myself included, had
almost identically, though seemingly unrelated interests. Computation theory,
type theory, and Programming Languages, to be sure --- but linguistics,
philosophy, and music as well. I began to realize I was not the only one who
saw these as deeply related fields.

After Google, I had time to pursuing lesser-delved interests and reflect. I had
grown largely disillusioned with CS, questioning the societal utility of the
tech industry. I found myself asking "how can I use my interests and skills
to make the world a better place". This perspecive allowed me to become much
more intentional with how I chose to direct myself.

Even in my gap year, I was always studying. I turned my love of language
learning into a C1 language certificate. Wishing to study more human topics, I
worked through undergraduate texts in linguistics, drawn into semantics,
morphosyntactic-semantic interaction, and pragmatics. I rediscovered a
love for teaching, helping friends and strangers with topics ranging from
English to software to type theory. I could articulate my answer: I
believe education is a fundamental good for society, and that I am uniquely
qualified to bring my understanding of formal structure to any number of fields.

I have been searching for Linguistics departments with strong backgrounds in
theory. My intention has been to combine my ability in Logic to a different
subject I love. It would both be a shift to a more human subject, but staying
true to my background and talents in more formal and abstract systems.
Then I learned about the Masters of Logic program at UvA.

It had not yet occurred to me that I could, in fact, study in a
department at the intersection of all of these topics I was drawn towards. This
program directly embodies what I was already setting out to do.

At UvA I would be able to explore these intersections directly. Whats more, the
strong research focus of the program would set me up well for a potential
career in academics, my ultimate goal. I wouldn't need to be an outsider in
a linguistics program with degrees in complete other fields, but could embrace
my eclectic nature, and apply it to hard interdisciplinary problems. The
structure of the program is highly individual, putting more emphasis on
research than rudimentary course work, while offering a uniquely exciting
course list. And because the program's nature, I can see myself having a wider
set of options for directions to take my eventual PhD. Prehaps I will find
myself moving back into computation or proof theory; perhaps deeper into
linguistics. Either way, MoL will prepare me for where I want to go next. I
think UvA's Master of Logic program is the perfect place for me to achieve my
goal of being a steward of knowledge.

In 2018 I left my job at Google. This wasn't because of some sort of lack of
success --- in fact, I was promoted much earlier than a traditional employee,
and was trusted with high level design and organizational work, beyond that of
an average software developer. I left because, in many ways, I had finished what
I came there to do: gain experience, collect capital, and get a taste for what
working in industry is like. This last point was very important to me.
**Sum: I left Google.**

Before Google, I studied at a small and intimate university, getting degrees in
both Mathematics and Computer Science. I might not have been the best student
on paper, but I excelled in most qualitative respects. I routinely set the
curve on examinations, demonstrating subject mastery. I was heavily involved in
teaching, TAing many courses, managing other TAs, writing course materials, and
making proposals to the department for curriculum changes. I was the goto
person on campus for the topics I identified with.
**Sum: I studied CS&Math. I excelled in my own way.**

Those topics were always growing and changing, but were rooted in theoretical
CS and formal logic. An interest in functional programing would bring me to
type theory; type theory to proof theory; proof theory to constructive logic,
category theory, recursion theory, semantics, and so on. None of these topics
were actually offered at my university, but I have always been comfortable
being an autodidact, and supplemented my own education (likely at the expense
of my own grades). As my graduation neared, it was slowly occurring to me that
such pure topics would have little place in industry.
**Sum: My interests while I was at university.**

My last summer before I graduated, I was lucky enough to take part in the
Oregon Programming Language Summer School. There I would be exposed to <list
of topics>. Beyond the excitement of being exposed to topics I could never get
back at my home university, I was taken by the other students. Specifically,
how we all seemed to have the same set of interests, even outside the subject
material at hand. Computation theory, type theory, and Programming Languages,
sure --- but linguistics, philosophy, and music as well. I had never realized
that I wasn't the only one who saw these fields as all being deeply related
(having not yet put the word "Logic" as a unifying label).
**Sum: I attended OPLSS. There I noticed the "logic pattern"**

After leaving Google, I had some time to myself to spend pursuing lesser-delved
hobbies, and think about where I saw myself. I had grown deeply disillusioned
with the study of computers, questioning the fundamental societal utility of
the tech industry. I found myself asking "how can I use my interests and skills
to make the world a better place" --- a hard question to when one is
sufficiently skeptical by nature. But this was prospective that I seriously
needed. As a student, I was more-or-less mindlessly going through the motions,
somewhat selfishly studying whatever sparked my interests, without seeing my
place or the place of that knowledge in the world around me. Now I was going
about my decision making with much more intentionality.
**Sum: I became skeptical, and more intentional after google.**

This period I found that, even while traveling and relaxing, I was always
studying; I turned my love of language learning into a C1 language certificate,
a wish to study things more connected to humanity manifested itself into me
working through undergraduate texts in linguistics, being drawn into semantics,
morphosyntactic-semantic interaction, and pragmatics. I walked around with
notebooks filled with research questions. Most importantly, I rediscovered a
love for teaching, helping friends and strangers with topics ranging from
English to software to type theory. Finally, I could articulate my answer: I
believe education is a fundamental good for society, and that I am uniquely
qualified to bring my understanding of formal structure to any number of fields.
**Sum: I began focusing on lingustics. I found the answer.**

I then went out in search of Linguistics departments with strong backgrounds in
theory, thinking I could bring my unique perspectives there, and knowing I
enjoyed the topic. It would both be a shift to a more human subject, but staying
true to my background and talents in more formal and abstract systems. Then,
one day in the halls of the University of Vienna, I saw a poster for the
Masters of Logic program, and was immediately taken. Just like the feeling I
had at OPLSS --- it had never occurred to me that I could, in fact, study in a
department at the intersection of all of these topics I was drawn towards. This
program directly embodies what I was already setting out to do.
**Sum: looking for linguistics programs. Found MoL.**

At UvA I would be able to explore these intersections directly. Whats more, the
strong research focus of the program would set me up well for a potential
career in academics, my ultimate goal. I wouldn't need to be an outsider in
a linguistics program with degrees in complete other fields, but could embrace
my eclectic nature, and apply it to hard interdisciplinary problems. The
structure of the program is highly individual, putting more emphasis on
research than rudimentary course work, while offering a uniquely exciting
course list. And because the program's nature, I can see myself having a wider
set of options for directions to take my eventual PhD. Prehaps I will find
myself moving back into computation or proof theory; perhaps deeper into
linguistics. Either way, MoL will prepare me for where I want to go next. I
think UvA's Master of Logic program is the perfect place for me to achieve my
goal of being a steward of knowledge.
**Sum: Why UvA is right for me**

<!---
I am applying to the Master of Logic, with particular interest in
the Logic and Language track. By entering into a Masters program, I hope to
progress into a career in academics, using my skills as a communicator and
teacher to make a real positive societal impact through education, as well as
bringing my unique capacities and perspectives in formal structures to
interdisciplinary questions, offering new and divers perspectives. In
particular, the study of Logic bring together my elect
interests together into a unified


**Should there be a story somewhere? A narrative structure?**
**wow, starting this is actually really awkward. Is there some kind of catch
statement I might want to employ?**
**I need to have a list of MUST ADDRESS**
**The FIRST line should be I want to X Y Z. I HAVE to open with that.**
**The difference between studying the systems that people built, and the
systems that build people**

Wanting to be involved in the sharing and creation of knowledge is fundamental
to my character, and studying Logic is the most direct path, sitting at the
crossroads of my experience, interests, and what I find to be fundamental to
the human experience.

It is my mission to be involved in the sharing and creation of knowledge. The
study of Logic, as I see it, is the most direct path, sitting at the crossroads
of my experiences, interests, and concept of the fundamental human experience.

It is my mission to use my abilities as a creator, thinker, and communicator to
be involved in the sharing and creation of knowledge to have a positive impact
on the people and communities around me.

It is my mission to be involved in the sharing, preservation, and creation of
knowledge. I want to use the skills I think that are unique to me, and bring
them to add prospective to other peoples lives. The study of Logic, for me, is
both the most exciting as well as blah blah blah. That's almost it.

It is my mission to involve myself in the sharing, collection, and creation of
knowledge. I want to bring my technical understanding of structure to new
depths, apply them to new fields, and use my talent as a comunicator to bring
them to other people.

It is my mission to involve myself in the sharing, collection, and creation of
knowledge. I believe that education (at all levels) provide a fundamental good
for society, and I want to catalyze a love-for-knowledge in others. I see my
talents lying in working in highly abstract structures and communicating
abstract ideas. To that end, I see myself pursuing a career in academia.

In the broadest sense, my mission is the sharing, collection, and creation of
knowledge. I believe that education provides a fundamental good for society,
and I hope to catalyze a love-for-knowledge in others. The talents I have are
in highly abstract and formal structures, as well as communicating abstract
ideas. Therefor, I see my greatest possible impact lying in a career in
academia. For me, the study of logic is the most exciting actualiztion

It is my mission to involve myself in the communication, collection, and
creation of knowledge, using talents and skills unique to me, working within
subject areas that excite me and provide utility to others. For me, this means
pursuing a career in academia.

In the broadest sense, my mission is the sharing, collection, and creation of
knowledge. The study of Logic, for me, is one of the most ideal actualizations
of this mission, taking a wide set of my eclectic interests, unifying them
within abstract and formal systems I feel I uniquely excel with, and


Dont make this about where I *don't* belong --- stay positive.

I was critical of
- the roll in society
- were these problems hard problems?
- did this line up with my interests?

Above all, I want to be involved in the transmission of knowledge.


In 2018, after much success at the company, I left my job at Google. I had
finished what I came there to do --- get experience, collect capital, and get
an idea about if I could see myself working in industry.

-- Jump back to me in school, and my academic interests -- <- Does that belong later?
-- What did I do in my gap --

When
joining in 2016, I had the explicit intension of deciding how I felt about
industry.

1. Who am I?
**An overview of my life story**
**I was in industry, and it gave me prospective**
**What did I feel was missing in industry**
**During my undergrad, what were my interests, and why?**
**The role of summer 2015, and it's impact on me**
2. What have I done?
**My interests always take me back to structure, and as studdy of what I've
come to identify as Universal Grammar**
**How have my interests shifted?**
**Who was I in School? Who was I in industry? Who was I in my gap?**
**My experience with Logic.**
**What is my background exactly? CS & Mathematics. What specifically within
those?**
**I was missing this study in my undergraduate**
3. What do I want to do?
**I believe in the enterprise of education**
**I want to be a transmitter of knoweledge**
**The role of Linguistics in my life today**
**What I think I can do --- particular interest of Native American lanuage
study and preservation. My Exposure to Navajo**
**An overview of my future plans. Who do I want to become**
**Where do I see Logic in place with my interests**
**What do I see myself doing after the program**
**I bellieve understanding UG and Morphosyntax - semantic relationships
and the study of logic are ultimately isomorphic**
**Understanding UG and logic opens up the following for us as a society**
4. Why can I do it here?
  a. Which Track am I looking at, and why?
**What do I think I can take away from the program in Amsterdam? Why this
program and not another one?**
**Why was I excited about this program? Inter-disiplinary and multi-cultural.**
**What do I see myself doing in the program?**
**The role of being surrounded by others**

Is there more to it than that? That feels very general. Let's try and move the
points above into these.
