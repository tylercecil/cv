I believe the biggest and most positive impact I can have on society is to
become a professor --- a great communicator of complex ideas. My background
is in math & CS, with an emphasis on theory and logic. After time in industry
at Google and much self exploration, my focus has shifted to linguistics. It
is my intention to apply my talents in formal systems to this subject, which I
see as fundamental to the human experience.

In 2018 I left Google. After promotions and much success, I had finished what I
came there to do: gain experience, collect capital, and get a taste for what
working in industry is like.

Before industry, I studied at a small university. Though not the best student
on paper, qualitatively I excelled, receiving exemplar test and project grades.
I was heavily involved in teaching (a passion of mine), designing course
materials, TAing, making department curriculum proposals, and even teaching a
course on Proof Theory in Coq.  Academically my interests went from
functional programming to type theory, to constructive logic, category theory,
recursion theory, semantics, etc. None of these topics were offered at my
university, so I self-supplemented my education.  In 2015, I took part in the
Oregon Programming Language Summer School, where I was taken by the fact that
all the students, myself included, had almost identical, though seemingly
unrelated, interests --- all that comes with programming language theory, to be
sure, but also linguistics, philosophy, music, and cognition. I began to
realize just how connected these topics were.

After Google, I had time to dive into my other interests and reflect. Largely
disillusioned with the societal utility of the tech industry, I asked myself
"how can I use my interests and skills to make the world a better
place". My time in and after Google has allowed me become much more intentional
in how I to direct myself. During my gap year, I was always studying. I turned
my love of language learning into a C1 language certificate. I worked through
undergraduate texts in linguistics, drawn into semantics its interactions with
morphosyntax and pragmatics. Seeing how I naturally spend my time, and reminded
of my love of teaching, I could articulate an answer to my question: I believe
education is a fundamental good, and that I am uniquely qualified to bring my
background in formal systems to different fields.

Although lacking a linguistic background, a shift to the field represents to me
re-imagining how my interest in Logic can be directed back onto humanity.
In the hunt for Linguistics programs with strong emphasis on theory, I learned
about the Masters of Logic program at Universiteit van Amsterdam.

It had not yet occurred to me that I could, in fact, study in a department at
the intersection of all of these topics I was drawn towards. This program
directly embodies what I was already setting out to do.

At UvA I could directly investigate my eclectic interests with equally eclectic
peers from all over the world. I could hardly believe the course list I was
looking at. The program's strong research focus tells me that it will prepare
me for my goal of a career in academics. It also reflects the individual and
autodidactic character of the department. In a traditional Linguistics program,
I would be required to take the undergraduate courses missing in my background.
At UvA, however, I could use the background I've already gathered and dive
right into the intersection of Logic and Language.  And because of the
program's nature, I'll be left with a more diverse set of directions to take an
eventual PhD. Perhaps I will find myself moving back to computation theory;
perhaps deeper into linguistics. Either way, the Masters of Logic program is
the perfect place for me to realize my goals.


<!-- This needs a bit more focus/structure
1. Eclectic, exactly my focus
1a. The people, the subjects
2. Research focus
2a. Autodidact
3. More direct than going into a linguistics program
4. Flexibility after

At UvA I would be able to explore these intersections directly. Whats more, the
strong research focus of the program would set me up well for a potential
career in academics, my ultimate goal. I wouldn't need to be an outsider in
a linguistics program with degrees in complete other fields, but could embrace
my eclectic nature, and apply it to hard interdisciplinary problems. The
structure of the program is highly individual, putting more emphasis on
research than rudimentary course work, while offering a uniquely exciting
course list. And because the program's nature, I can see myself having a wider
set of options for directions to take my eventual PhD. Prehaps I will find
myself moving back into computation or proof theory; perhaps deeper into
linguistics. Either way, MoL will prepare me for where I want to go next. I
think UvA's Master of Logic program is the perfect place for me to achieve my
goal of being a steward of knowledge.
