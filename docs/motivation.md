I believe the biggest and most positive impact I can have on society is to
become a professor --- a great communicator of complex ideas. My background
is in math & CS, with an emphasis on theory and logic. After time in industry
at Google and much self exploration, my focus has shifted to linguistics. It
is my intention to apply my talents in formal systems to this subject, which I
see as fundamental to the human experience.

In 2018 I left my job at Google. After promotions and much success, I had
finished what I came there to do: gain experience, collect capital, and get a
taste for what working in industry is like.

Before industry, I studied at a small university. Though not the best student
on paper, qualitatively I excelled, receiving exemplar test and project grades.
I was heavily involved in teaching (a passion of mine), designing course
materials, TAing courses, making department curriculum proposals, and even
teaching a course on proof theory in Coq.  Academically my interests went from
functional programming to type theory, to constructive logic, category theory,
recursion theory, semantics, etc. None of these topics were offered at my
university, so I self-supplemented my education.  In 2015, I took part in the
Oregon Programming Language Summer School, where I was taken by the fact that
all the students, myself included, had almost identical, though seemingly
unrelated, interests. All that comes with programming language theory, to be
sure --- but also linguistics, philosophy, music, and cognition as well. I
began to realize just how these topics were connected.

After Google, I had time to dive into my other interests and reflect.  Largely
disillusioned with the societal utility of the tech industry, I asked myself
"how can I use my interests and skills to make the world a better
place". My time in and after Google has allowed me become much more intentional
in how I to direct myself.  In my gap year, I was always studying. I turned my
love of language learning into a C1 language certificate. I worked through
undergraduate texts in linguistics, drawn into semantics,
morphosyntactic-semantic interaction, and pragmatics. Looking at how I chose to
spend my time outside of all influence, and reminded of my love of teaching, I
could articulate an answer to my question: I believe education is a fundamental
good, and that I am uniquely qualified to bring my background in formal systems
to new fields.

I have been searching for Linguistics departments with strong backgrounds in
theory. My intention has been to combine my ability in Logic to a different
subject I love. It would both be a shift to a more human subject, but staying
true to my background and talents in more formal and abstract systems.
Then I learned about the Masters of Logic program at UvA.

It had not yet occurred to me that I could, in fact, study in a
department at the intersection of all of these topics I was drawn towards. This
program directly embodies what I was already setting out to do.

At UvA I would be able to explore these intersections directly. Whats more, the
strong research focus of the program would set me up well for a potential
career in academics, my ultimate goal. I wouldn't need to be an outsider in
a linguistics program with degrees in complete other fields, but could embrace
my eclectic nature, and apply it to hard interdisciplinary problems. The
structure of the program is highly individual, putting more emphasis on
research than rudimentary course work, while offering a uniquely exciting
course list. And because the program's nature, I can see myself having a wider
set of options for directions to take my eventual PhD. Prehaps I will find
myself moving back into computation or proof theory; perhaps deeper into
linguistics. Either way, MoL will prepare me for where I want to go next. I
think UvA's Master of Logic program is the perfect place for me to achieve my
goal of being a steward of knowledge.
