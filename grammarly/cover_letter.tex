  To the Grammarly Hiring Staff \par \bigskip

  I'm a Software Engineer, with a background in Mathematics and a passion for
  Linguistics. Finding a place that engages those three skill sets, while
  simultaneously pushing forward knowledge and improving lives has seemed a
  pipe-dream. That's why the posting for "Applied Research Scientist" at
  Grammarly grabbed me. While a transition on paper, I think this position may
  have been made for me. \medskip

  % Possible ; Bring engineering, math to aid in ML, with a genuine love of the
  % problem space.
  % It's an Engineer who can uniquely bring the "Applied" half of "Applied
  % Research Scientist".
  % Explicitly spell out Applied=Engineer, Research Scientist=math

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring a high level of expertise
  writing efficient, maintainable, and testable production-quality code, beyond
  what a Data Scientist might have.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item At Google, I was promoted by my first year; not just for my coding
      skills, but for my initiative in identify the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probe-test framework.
      % Impact statement
    \item I thrive in ambiguity; at Los Alamos I was trusted to independently
      design a novel compiler extension, creating a project direction rather
      than being given one. The product enabled optimization of the parallel
      semantics tools like Tensor Flow use.
    \item I can apply both theoretical understanding of algorithms (such as
      those used in ML and NLP), as well as low-level understanding of how they
      run on metal.

      % This sentence needs to be fixed.
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My background in Mathematics} can transfer to a maturity with statistics,
  engagement with cutting-edge algorithms in NLP, and the production of sound
  experimental results.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item On my research blog, \cite{I have written on statistics}
      {https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020-05-10-bessel.html}
      in both theoretical and applied contexts.
    \item At Los Alamos and ICASA, I raised the impact of my work via academic
      research; for example, my investigations in Polyhedral Optimizations
      changed the direction of our compiler extension.
    \item Having taken courses on Prob and Stats, Linear Algebra, Modeling,
      Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Numerical Science, I'm excited to
      apply these skills to innovations like the Transformer Language Models
      being used at Grammarly.
      % Very nonsequetor
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Finally, my passion for Linguistics} adds a unique dimension to me as a
  candidate. With domain-specific knowledge, I can adapt quicker, stay up to
  date easier, and have more impact.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{I write
      frequently}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020-01-19-NPI.html} about Syntax,
      Morphology, and Semantics, striving to communicate complex ideas in
      simple ways.
    \item My last two years were spent in the self-study of languages and
      linguistics; knowledge and experience that can be immediately transfered
      to NLP.
      % C1 certificates? Textbooks? Where's the proof!
  \end{itemize}\medskip

  I am not a traditional applicant for this position; I have an eclectic
  background, rather than narrow experience with Scikit-Learn or XGBoost.  But
  there's a reason I want Grammarly, and why Grammarly might want me. I care
  about making language and communication more accessible for everybody. I can
  bring more Engineering expertise than your average Data Scientist. I have a
  stronger Mathematical maturity than your average Engineer. Combine that with
  my love of Linguistics, and you're left with a unique and strong candidate.
  \medskip

  % Possibly include "if another position fits"
  I would love an opportunity to discuss how I might contribute to Grammarly's
  mission of improving lives by improving communication. Please reach out to
  me, and we can schedule a call!  \bigskip

  Thank you so much for your time.
