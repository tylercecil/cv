  To the Grammarly Hiring Staff \par \bigskip

  I'm a Software Engineer, with a background in Mathematics and a passion for
  Linguistics. Finding a place that engages those three skill sets, while
  simultaneously pushing forward knowledge \emph{and} improving the lives of
  others has seemed a pipe-dream. So when I saw the posting for "Applied
  Research Scientist" at Grammarly, I could hardly believe my eyes. Would it be
  a transition for me? Yes. Yet I think I may be uniquely suited for Grammarly,
  and I cant tell Grammarly is perfectly suited for me. \medskip

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I can bring a high level of
  expertise in writing efficient, maintainable, and testable production-quality
  code, beyond what a Data Scientist might bring. It's an Engineer who can
  uniquely bring the "Applied" half of "Applied Research Scientist".
  \begin{itemize}
    \item At Google, I actively identified the need for, designed, and led the
      development of my projects, rather than ticking-off pre-identified tasks
      on an issue tracker. This led to my early promotion.
    \item At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, I designed a compiler
      extension to enable optimization of the kind of parallel semantics tools
      like Tensor Flow needs to perform well.
    \item I can bring both the theoretical understanding of traditional ML
      algorithms such as SVNs, Baysean Methods, and Nural Networks, as well as
      the low-level understanding of how they actually get run on metal.
      % \item "Solve problems that haven't been solved before"
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Augment that with my background in Mathematics}, and you have someone who
  is able to bring a mature understanding of statistics, as well as engage with
  cutting edge algorithms in ML and NLP.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{I have experience in statistics}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/}
      at both a theoretical and applied level.
    \item At New Mexico Tech I took courses on Probability and Statistics and
      Linear Algebra, but also Mathematical Modeling, Machine Learning, Data
      Mining, and Numerical Science.
    \item At Los Alamost and I.C.A.S.A., I was able to use my mathematical
      experience to engage in academic research, raising the impact of my work.
      % Key words "sampling methodologies"
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Finally, it's my Linguistics passion}, which adds a unique dimension
  to me as a candidate. With a priori domain-specific knowledge of the problem
  space, I can adapt quicker, identify needs faster, and keep up with field
  research easier.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{I write
      often}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020-01-19-NPI.html} about Syntax,
      Morphology, and Semantics, always striving to take complex theories to a
      more general audience.
    \item Transformer Models.
    \item I have basic experience with NLP tools, such as NLTK, and have small-
      scale experience with Markovian language models.
  \end{itemize}\medskip

  I'm aware I might not be a typical applicant for this position. For instance,
  you may have noticed a two-year gap on my resume; I spent those years cycling
  across the world, indulging in my passion for languages, and thinking about
  what direction I want to take myself next. I may not have industry experience
  with Tensor Flow, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, or NLP, but I have the background
  necessary to adapt quickly and contribute effectively.\medskip

  I care about making language and communication more accessible to everybody
  --â€” Grammarly does that, tearing down the barrier grammar and spelling puts
  between education, employment, and beyond. I assume I'm different from
  other Engineers who may apply; there's a reason you want Grammarly &
  Grammarly might want me. I can bring more Engineering expertise than your
  average Data Scientist. I have a stronger Mathematical maturity than your
  average Engineer. Combine that with my love and knowledge of Linguistics,
  and you're left with a unique and strong option for this position. \medskip

  Of course, if you feel there is another role at Grammarly I would be
  interested to hear. I can tell you though, this position feels exactly like
  what I've been looking for. I would love an opportunity to discuss how I
  might contribute to Grammarly's mission of improving lives by improving
  communication. Please reach out to me, and we can schedule something!
  \bigskip

  Thank you for your time!

  Tyler Cecil
