  To the Grammarly Hiring Staff \par \bigskip

  I'm a Software Engineer, with a background in Mathematics and a passion for
  Linguistics. Finding a place that engages those three skill sets, while
  simultaneously pushing forward knowledge and improving lives has seemed a
  pipe-dream. That's why the posting for "Applied Research Scientist" at
  Grammarly grabbed me. While a transition on paper, I think I may be uniquely
  suited for this position. \medskip

  % Possible ; Bring engineering, math to aid in ML, with a genuine love of the
  % problem space.
  % It's an Engineer who can uniquely bring the "Applied" half of "Applied
  % Research Scientist".
  % Explicitly spell out Applied=Engineer, Research Scientist=math

  \hl{As an experienced Software Engineer}, I bring a high level of expertise
  writing efficient, maintainable, and testable production-quality code, beyond
  what a Data Scientist might have.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item At Google, I was promoted by my first year; not just for my coding
      skills, but for my initiative identify the need for, designing, and
      implementing a critical probe-test framework.
      % Impact statement
    \item I thrive in ambiguity; at Los Alamos I was trusted to independently
      design a novel compiler extension, creating a project direction rather
      than being given one. The result enabled optimization of the parallel
      semantics tools like Tensor Flow use.
    \item I can bring both the theoretical understanding of traditional ML
      algorithms such as SVNs, Bayesian Methods, and Nural Networks, as well as
      the low-level understanding of how they run on metal.
      % Does this belong here, or under math?
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{My background in Mathematics} easily transfers to a mature understanding
  of statistics, as well as ability to engage with cutting edge algorithms in
  ML and NLP.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item On my research blog, \cite{I have written on statistics}
      {https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020-05-10-bessel.html}
      in both theoretical and applied contexts.
    \item At Los Alamos and ICASA, I raised the impact of my work with academic
      research; for example, my investigation in modern Polyhedral
      Optimizations changed the direction of our compiler extension.
    \item I'm excited to transfer these skills to cutting-edge NLP, having
      taken courses on Prob and Stats, Linear Algebra, Modeling, Machine
      Learning, Data Mining, and Numerical Science.
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \hl{Finally, it's my Linguistics passion}, which adds a unique dimension to
  me as a candidate. With domain-specific knowledge, I can adapt quicker, keep
  up with field research easier, and make a bigger impact.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{I write
      often}{https://tylercecil.com/posts/2020-01-19-NPI.html} about Syntax,
      Morphology, and Semantics, striving to communicate complex ideas in
      simple ways.
    \item My last two years were spent in the self-study of languages and
      linguistics; knowledge and experience that can be immediately applied to
      NLP.
      % C1 certificates? Textbooks? Where's the proof!
  \end{itemize}\medskip

  I am not a traditional applicant for this position; I have an eclectic
  background, rather than narrow experience with Scikit-Learn or XGBoost.  But
  there's a reason I want Grammarly, and why Grammarly might want me. I care
  about making language and communication more accessible to everybody. I can
  bring more Engineering expertise than your average Data Scientist. I have a
  stronger Mathematical maturity than your average Engineer. Combine that with
  my love of Linguistics, and you're left with a unique and strong candidate.
  \medskip

  % Possibly include "if another position fits"
  I would love an opportunity to discuss how I might contribute to Grammarly's
  mission of improving lives by improving communication. Please reach out to
  me, and we can schedule something!  \bigskip

  Thank you for your time!
