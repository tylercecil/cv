It's simple â€” I want a career I can be proud of, making a real positive impact on the world.

I'm a Senior-level software engineer, with a strong background in mathematics, and years of experience in Big Tech. Though successful, I grew disillusioned with my career, and began to realize just how important a mission I believe in is for me. After some soul searching, I resolved to pivot into climate, and apply my skills and abilities to solutions with real impact on our planet.

In particular, I've zoomed in on energy. Why? I see energy as the sector I can have the biggest impact in. It's both one of the most vital arenas for climate solutions, is a growing and active field, as well as compliments my skills in software and mathematics. The energy sector feels like a place which can use all the skills I have to offer, and make a real positive change in our world.

Voltus in particular is exceptionally exciting to me, and a place I hope to build a long-term career at, using my background to its fullest and growing into my professional goals. It's not just that the work seems exciting, but the culture seems so aligned with my values. Voltus seems like a company which cares about people inside the company and out, and about the effect they do and could have on our world. This is a company I want to be part of.

I'm so excited to connect and discuss the role I could play at Voltus! For more information, please see the cover letter I've attached to my resume PDF. Thank you so much for your time!
